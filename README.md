  <h1> Angular .htaccess generator</h1>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use way to create .htaccess files for individual Angular applications. You can find the web-application here: https://julianpoemp.github.io/ngx-htaccess-generator/.

## Why?

Because an Angular app that uses the PathLocationStrategy can't be served on a Apache web server without further configuration. Without a .htaccess file the web server does not know how to handle paths generated by Angular e.g. on reload. That also happens when you try to laod your app's URL directly e.g. www.myapp.test/page1/section1. This would lead to a page not found exception.
The solution is an .htaccess file: It redirects the requests to your app's index.html where your app is initialized. After that angular reads the request and outputs the content. With the reloading issue is fixed.

## Features
